# Configuration/TypoScript/

TypoScript files from this directory can be included manually.

Please note that TypoScript loaded here applies across all sites. If you want to create site-specific TypoScript, as is normally the case with a sitepackage, then use Site Sets under `Configuration/Sets/` as of TYPO3 v13.
