# Configuration/TypoScript/

TypoScript files from this directory can be included manually.

> Please note that the TypoScript located here still has to be integrated in the old-fashioned way via Static Include
> using the `sys_template` record. As soon as you have defined a Site Set under `Configuration/Sets/`, as is the case by
> default for this sitepackage, this is no longer possible.
